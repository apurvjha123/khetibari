# Khetibari

As the name suggest , Khetibari is a platform where Farmer and Buyer meets. They can buy or sell the grains. It is a basic project.

# What it does

It eliminates the middle man (Broker) and connect our seller direct to Buyer automatically price drop increases massively. So, The Seller get good Amount and Buyer get fresh Grains.
There is a Grains section (in app) where Farmers can add their product so that Buyers will come and buy the products which they want.
There is Pre order section as well where seller can add the specific requirement and will give certain span of time to complete the production and according to that time a farmer who is interested to produce that product can assign themselves and on the completion of their work , Buyer will give money as how much they promise.

# inspiration

Being from farmer background, I know the felling when a farmer puts
lot of effort, time and money in their crops, and they can't even retrieve the money they invested , They gradually become poor day by day.


# What problem does it solve 

My father is a small farmer and when ho go to sell his product to mandi he gets even less price than how much it had costed him to grow this crops, but they don't have any other alternative than to sell the crops at mandi.
The buyer also want to buy the product direct from farmer as they are fresh, very healthy, high nutrients but don't have any platform to connect both.
To solve this issue we came with idea to connect both of them.

# How I build it

I built this using MERN (MongoDB, Express ,React , Nodejs). Firstly, I started with the frontend and then backend. Firstly I did designing part where I stuck lot of time because i not good at designing then moved to specify routes where I used react-router-dom. Then went to backend and created Product Schema with the help of MongoDB after that I made the route of that product with the help of express and verified the route using thunder client. Then I connect the backend to my frontend using axios and then i made registration design, made schema and routes and connected it and again , repeated the same process with pre order. After completing the project, I deployed it to Netlify (FrontEnd) and Heroku(backend).

# Problem I faced

I got stuck a lot of time for some small concept that is not cleared as it is my first full stack project that I made. I don't have any team to help me out, I had to make this project alone so i took me more than two weeks to complete it because of 9 to 5 college schedule I was unable to give much time every day.
Sometime error took hours to resolve, but at the end of the day I solved every problem and made this project successfully.

# why I am proud of this project

Throughout the project i had faced lots of problem and after resolving it , It feels like some sort of achievement to me. I used time very efficient even though I can't give more than 4 hours a day I used that time very productively and I fell my problem solving skill was increasing day by day throughout the project.


# what I learned

I learned a lot of things. Proper use of react hooks like useEffect, useState etcâ€¦
In the whole process i learned axios, dotenv , Heroku's deployment very well and most importantly I learn Productivity.
